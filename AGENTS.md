# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`llm_api_proxy_recorder/` contains the Python application. Keep HTTP forwarding in `proxy/`, persistence and parsing in `recording/`, management endpoints in `admin/`, terminal support in `terminal/`, and browser assets in `web/static/`. Tests live in `tests/` and mirror these responsibilities through files such as `test_router.py` and `test_store.py`.

The desktop shell is split across `src-tauri/` (Rust/Tauri), `desktop/` (startup page), `packaging/` (PyInstaller spec), and `scripts/` (platform build helpers). Generated data belongs in `.runtime/`; build outputs under `build/`, `dist/`, and `src-tauri/target/` must remain untracked.

## OpenCode Integration & API Compatibility

The workspace uses the OpenCode V1 `opencode serve` HTTP API, not the V2 API documented at https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/api. `llm_api_proxy_recorder/workspace/manager.py` starts one local subprocess per project on demand with `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port <random-port>`. Each server uses a randomly generated HTTP Basic password. The browser calls this application's FastAPI workspace routes; the backend forwards requests with `httpx` and relays SSE from `/event`. OpenCode owns conversation persistence.

Current API paths include `/global/health`, `/session`, `/agent`, `/config/providers`, and `/session/{id}/prompt_async`. V2 uses paths such as `/api/info`, `/api/session`, and `/api/agent`, and is not a drop-in replacement. A V2 migration must adapt endpoints, request/response structures, and event formats, with compatibility coverage; do not assume replacing the executable or adding an `/api` prefix is sufficient. Treat the running version's `/doc` OpenAPI description as the API contract.

The Windows installer bundles a pinned OpenCode CLI version from `packaging/opencode.json` (currently `1.18.32`). macOS normally resolves OpenCode from PATH; settings also support a custom command. The workspace still expects V1 API behavior regardless of executable source. Keep version-specific assumptions aligned with the packaging manifest and verify compatibility when upgrading.

The separate OpenCode terminal runs the native TUI through Windows ConPTY or macOS system PTY, with xterm.js and WebSocket transporting terminal input/output. Both workspace and terminal processes share environment setup in `terminal/manager.py`. Application providers are compiled by `admin/models.py` into namespaced native V1 providers through `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, without editing project or user files. Each model uses native `provider.api` and `provider.npm`; provider-level proxy switches choose dedicated `/managed/<provider-token>/<model-token>/…` recording routes or direct endpoints. Model-specific credentials override provider credentials, and empty credentials explicitly prevent native auth/environment fallback. Keep real proxy credentials out of native model metadata. Legacy terminal routing fields are read only for migration; model management is the authoritative configuration. Responses parsing and usage normalization run in the recording background, never in the forwarding loop.

Application skills are managed in `admin/skills.py` and `admin/skill_routes.py`. Import a single directory containing YAML-frontmatter `SKILL.md` and copy all resources into the application's isolated OpenCode config directory under `skills/<name>`. Enable/disable writes the official `permission.skill.<name>` allow/deny setting in the isolated `opencode.json[c]`, preserving other JSONC content; never move files to disable them. Startup migrates legacy `skills-disabled` copies into `skills` with deny permissions. Delete only application copies. Read the original OpenCode XDG config directory's `skills` and `skill` trees in place; inject non-conflicting external skill paths through native `skills.paths`. Never change original external files/config. Prefer application copies for duplicate names and mark external conflicts.

The skill page directly lists all application and external skills, with name/description search. Desktop imports use the Tauri dialog plugin's native directory picker (`core.invoke("plugin:dialog|open", {options: {directory: true}})`); plain browsers accept absolute paths. `/skills` lists enabled skills actually loaded at the expected native location and permitted for the selected agent. Selection/valid typed commands show a blue skill mention inline in the message composer; unknown commands show validation errors. Invoke through V1 `/session/{id}/command`, preserving native resource-base behavior. A generated native message ID links persisted manual invocation metadata in `.skill-uses` to the user message; history shows the selected skill inline with the task. Automatic `skill` tool calls and skill/resource reads show distinct visible cards with real pending/running/completed/error status. Never infer successful loading merely from composer selection.

Project file references also appear as blue inline mentions in the composer and user-message history, with full relative paths retained for serialization and tooltips. Derive outgoing references from the remaining composer mentions so deleting and undoing a mention update the payload; image previews remain above the input. One unmodified Backspace immediately after a skill/file mention (or its single inserted separator) deletes the whole mention through a native undoable edit, preserving surrounding text and IME composition.

Native deny permissions hide skills from the AI skill tool, but native slash commands may still exist: filter the picker/command menu and enforce disablement and agent permissions at the backend. Skill mutations reject active workspace tasks and restart idle servers to refresh native caches and process-scoped external paths; OpenCode owns conversation persistence. Existing native terminals require a restart. Cover copying, native permission persistence, legacy migration, external-source priority, traversal/symlink rejection, active-task protection, history metadata, and native command delegation in `tests/test_skills.py`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"` installs the Python app and test dependencies.
- `.venv/bin/python -m llm_api_proxy_recorder --config .runtime/config.json` starts the local proxy and admin UI.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` runs the full test suite.
- `npm ci` installs the pinned Tauri CLI dependencies.
- `npm run desktop:build` builds the macOS sidecar, `.app`, and `.dmg`.
- `npm run desktop:build:windows` builds the Windows sidecar and NSIS installer on Windows.
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check` verifies Rust formatting.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use four spaces in Python and follow PEP 8: `snake_case` functions/modules, `PascalCase` classes, and explicit type hints for public APIs. Keep JavaScript dependency-free and consistent with existing two-space indentation and `camelCase` names. Format Rust with `cargo fmt`; prefer small functions with explicit error propagation. Preserve the proxy's byte-transparent forwarding behavior and keep parsing or disk writes off the response hot path.

## Testing Guidelines

Pytest and `pytest-asyncio` are configured in `pyproject.toml`. Name files `test_*.py`, classes `Test...`, and functions `test_*`. Add regression coverage for routing, SSE streaming, redaction, persistence, and platform-specific terminal behavior. Run all tests before pushing; `main` also builds the Windows installer in GitHub Actions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History uses short imperative summaries in Chinese or English, sometimes Conventional Commit style (`feat(terminal): ...`). Prefer `type(scope): summary` when practical and keep each commit focused. Pull requests should explain behavior changes, list verification commands, link relevant issues, and include screenshots for Web UI changes. Call out platform-specific packaging effects.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit `.runtime/`, API keys, call recordings, generated sidecars, or local demo captures. Use masked example credentials and verify header-redaction tests when touching proxy or recording code.
